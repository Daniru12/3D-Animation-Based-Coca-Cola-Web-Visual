# 3D Animation-Based Coca-Cola Web Visual

This project demonstrates an interactive **3D animation**-based web visual designed for **Coca-Cola** branding. It is built using **React** and **JavaScript** and features smooth, dynamic animations that bring the Coca-Cola branding to life on the web. This is an engaging and visually appealing web experience that showcases Coca-Cola in a creative and immersive way using 3D elements.

---

## Features

* **Interactive 3D Animation**: Rendered animations that react to user interactions.
* **Smooth Transitions**: Seamless and dynamic visual transitions for a responsive experience.
* **Coca-Cola Themed**: Designed specifically for the Coca-Cola branding, using their logo, colors, and visual identity.
* **Web-Optimized**: Lightweight, optimized for fast rendering and smooth user interaction.
* **Cross-Browser Support**: Ensures compatibility with modern web browsers.
* **Customizable**: Easily adaptable to showcase different branding visuals.

---

## Tech Stack

* **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces, with a focus on component-based architecture.
* **JavaScript**: Core language for web development and 3D animation manipulation.
* **Three.js**: JavaScript library for 3D graphics rendering, used for the animation and interactive 3D elements.
* **WebGL**: Used for rendering 3D graphics within the browser.
* **CSS3**: For styling and animation effects.
* **HTML5**: Standard for structuring the web page.

---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following installed on your machine:

* **Node.js** (LTS version recommended)
* **npm** (Node package manager)
* **React** (latest stable version)

---

## Installation

### Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/3D-Animation-Based-Coca-Cola-Web-Visual.git
```

### Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project folder and install the required dependencies:

```bash
cd 3D-Animation-Based-Coca-Cola-Web-Visual
npm install
```

This will install all the required dependencies listed in `package.json`.

### Run the Project

To start the development server and view the project locally:

```bash
npm start
```

This will launch the project in your default web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

---

## Usage

Once the application is running, users can interact with the 3D animations directly on the webpage. Some key interactions include:

1. **Hover Effects**: Hover over Coca-Cola elements to trigger animation effects.
2. **Click Interaction**: Click on objects to see more details or trigger additional animations.
3. **Responsive Design**: The 3D visual adjusts dynamically across different screen sizes and devices.
